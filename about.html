            <h3 class="">Computer Science Student</h3>
            <p class="card_content">
                My name is Mariana Lemus Esguerra. I was born in Medellín, Colombia, on March 8, 2005. From an early age, I have shown interest in crafts, art, technology, and numbers. My educational journey began at Cascanueces kindergarten, continued at Colegio Gimnasio Los Cedros, and later at Institución Santa Catalina de Siena, where I completed my secondary education.
                <br></br>   
                Thanks to my effort and discipline, I significantly improved my English level during my studies, which has allowed me to expand my academic and cultural horizons. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Systems and Computer Engineering at EIA University, driven by my interest in technology and my desire to explore new areas of knowledge.
                <br></br> 
                Throughout my life, I have had the unconditional support of my mother María de Pilar Esguerra, who has been my greatest inspiration and David King who has been a father figure to me, contributing both to my personal and academic development. I dream of combining my passion for art with technology, aspiring to turn my creative talent into a complementary source of income.
                <br></br> 
                With an optimistic and persevering vision, I seek to keep growing. My goal is to acquire new knowledge and leave a positive mark on those around me.

            <h3 class="">Hobbies</h3>
            <p class="card_content">
                Outside of my academic journey, I have always enjoyed exploring various creative activities. My primary hobbies include drawing, crafts, digital art, playing video games and streaming, which allow me to express myself and improve my artistic skills. These hobbies are not only a form of entertainment but also a way to disconnect, boost my creativity, and explore new artistic techniques.
                <br></br> 
                Drawing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Over the years, I have focused on improving my technique, particularly in digital art. This passion has motivated me to create artwork that I hope to monetize in the future as an additional source of income.
                <br></br> 
                Additionally, I enjoy learning independently about topics that spark my curiosity, such as technology, animation, and design. These interests align with my professional goal of combining art and technology to create innovative projects.
